# SL Rental System 

This project holds the back-end to a front-end of an SL Rental System.

All the front end is written in LSL in world.

## Tech Stack

- TypeScript
- TypeORM
- PostgreSQL
- LSL


## Conception

Originally this was written for someone who wanted to know the basics of how "magic links" worked.

This is most definitely not "production ready", it can be improved

I welcome PULL REQUESTS


## TODO

Unit tests.

Unfortunately, this was a rush project and no unit tests were made.

I'll have to get around to it at some point.
